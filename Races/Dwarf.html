  <h1>Dwarf</h1>
	<p> 
		"Yer late, elf!" came the rough edge of a familiar
		voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his
		dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay
		on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort,
		the dwarf's long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome
		sight to Drizzt. "Knew I'd find ye in trouble if I came out
		an' looked for ye!" <br>
		-R. A . Salvatore, The Crystal Shard 
		<br> <br>
		Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the
		roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers
		in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to
		clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and
		orcs these common threads unite all dwarves.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2> Short and Stout </h2>
	<p>
		Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as
		skilled warriors, miners, and workers
		of stone and metal. Though they stand
		well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so
		broad and compact that they can weigh
		as much as a human standing nearly two
		feet taller. Their courage and endurance
		are also easily a match for any of
		the larger folk. <br>
		Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler
		hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are
		light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth.
		Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually
		black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have
		red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and
		groom them carefully.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>Long Memory, Long Grudges</h2>
	<p>
		Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the
		oldest living dwarves often remember a very different
		world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living
		in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms)
		can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when
		orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile
		that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a
		perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as
		humans and halflings lack. 
		<br>
		Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains
		they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic
		endurance and little change. They respect the traditions
		of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the
		founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth
		of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly.
		Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the
		dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious
		labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.
		Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to
		their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point
		of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense
		of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have
		suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to
		the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's
		hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Clans and Kingdoms</h2>
	<p>
		Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains
		where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals
		and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and
		artistry of precious metals and fine jewellery, and in some
		dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth
		they can't find in their mountains, they gain through
		trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and
		halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods
		along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races
		are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas
		are off limits even to them. <br>
		The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and
		dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves
		who live far from their own kingdom s cherish their clan
		identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves,
		and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses.
		To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
		Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans,
		especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewellers. Some
		become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after
		for their courage and loyalty.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>Gods, Gold, and Clan</h2>
	<p>
		Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be
		motivated by a desire for treasure for its own sake, for
		a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to
		help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command
		or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a
		desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and
		ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might
		seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient
		wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the
		clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search
		for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field
		of battle centuries ago.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>Dwarf Names</h2>
	<p>
		A dwarf's name is granted by a clan elder, in accordance
		with tradition. Every proper dwarven name has been
		used and reused down through the generations. A
		dwarf's name belongs to the clan, not to the individual.
		A dwarf who misuses or brings sham e to a clan name
		is stripped of the name and forbidden by law to use any
		dwarven name in its place. <br><br>
