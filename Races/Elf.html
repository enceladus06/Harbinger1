  <h1>Elf</h1>
  <p> "I HAVE NEVER IMAGINED SUCH BEAUTY EXISTED," <br>
			Goldmoon said softly. The day's march had been difficult,
			but the reward at the end was beyond their dreams.
			The companions stood on a high cliff over the fabled
			city of Qualinost. <br>
			Four slender spires rose from the city's corners like glistening spindles, their brilliant white stone marbled with shining
			silver. Graceful arches, swooping from spire to spire, soared
			through the air. Crafted by ancient dwarven metalsmiths,
			they were strong enough to hold the weight of an army, yet
			they appeared so delicate that a bird lighting on them might
			overthrow the balance. These glistening arches were the
			city's only boundaries; there was no wall around Qualinost.
			The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. <br>
			-Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight

	<h2> Slender and Graceful </h2>
	<p>
		With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves
		appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and m em bers
		of many other races. They are slightly shorter than
		humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet
		tall to just over 6 feet. They are m ore slender than
		humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. M ales and
		females are about the same height, and males are only
		marginally heavier than females.
		Elves’ coloration encom passes the normal human
		range and also includes skin in shades of copper,
		bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue,
		and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no
		facial and little body hair. They favor elegant clothing in
		bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>A Timeless Perspective</h2>
	<p>
		Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad
		perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races m ore deeply. They are m ore often amused
		than excited, and m ore likely to be curious than
		greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty
		happenstance. W hen pursuing a goal, however, whether 
		adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art,
		elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to
		make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget
		them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to
		serious insults with vengeance.
		Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible
		in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and
		com prom ise to resolve differences before they escalate
		to violence. They have been known to retreat from
		intrusions into their w oodland hom es, confident
		that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when
		the need arises, elves reveal a stern martial side,
		demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Hidden Woodland Realms</h2>
	<p>
		M ost elves dwell in small forest villages hidden am ong
		the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow
		vegetables, and their skill and m agic allow them to
		support themselves without the need for clearing and
		plowing land. They are talented artisans, crafting finely
		worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with
		outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a
		good living by trading crafted items for metals (which
		they have no interest in mining).
		Elves encountered outside their ow n lands are
		com m only traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human
		nobles com pete for the services of elf instructors to
		teach swordplay or m agic to their children
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>Exploration and Adventure</h2>
	<p>
		Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since
		they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of
		exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of
		human society, which is regimented from day to day but
		constantly changing over decades, so they find careers
		that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves
		also enjoy exercising their martial prow ess or gaining
		greater magical power, and adventuring allows them
		to do so. S om e might join with rebels fighting against
		oppression, and others might becom e cham pions of
		moral causes.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>Elf Names</h2>
	<p>
		Elves are considered children until they declare
		themselves adults, som e time after the hundredth
		birthday, and before this period they are called
		by child names. <br>
		On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name,
		although those w ho knew him or her as a youngster
		might continue to use the child name. Each elf’s adult
		name is a unique creation, though it might reflect
		the nam es o f respected individuals or other family
		m em bers. Little distinction exists between male
		nam es and female names; the groupings here reflect
		only general tendencies. In addition, every elf bears a
		family name, typically a com bination of other Elvish
		words. Som e elves traveling am ong humans translate
		their family nam es into Com m on, but others retain the
		Elvish version.

	<h3>Elf Traits</h3>
	<p  style="text-align:left">
		Your elf character has a variety o f natural abilities, the
		result o f thousands o f years of elven refinement.
		<br>
		<b>Ability Score Increase.</b> Your Dexterity score
		increases by 2.
		<br>
		<b>Age.</b> Although elves reach physical maturity at about
		the sam e age as humans, the elven understanding of
		adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encom pass
		worldly experience. An elf typically claim s adulthood
		and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live
		to be 750 years old.
		<br>
		<b>Alignment.</b> Elves love freedom , variety, and selfexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler
		aspects of chaos. They value and protect others'
		freedom as well as their own, and they are more
		often good than not. The drow are an exception; their
		exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and
		dangerous. D row are m ore often evil than not.
		<br>
		<b>Size.</b> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and
		have slender builds. Your size is Medium.
		<br>
		<b>Speed.</b> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
		<br>
		<b>Darkvision.</b> Accustom ed to twilit forests and the night
		sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
		You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it
		w ere bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
		You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
		<br>
		<b>Keen Senses.</b> You have proficiency in the
		Perception skill.
		<br>
		<b>Fey Ancestry.</b> You have advantage on saving throws
		against being charm ed, and m agic can’t put you to sleep.
		<br>
		<b>Trance.</b> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they
		meditate deeply, remaining sem iconscious, for 4
		hours a day. (The Com m on w ord for such meditation
		is “trance.”) W hile meditating, you can dream after a
		fashion; such dream s are actually mental exercises that
		have becom e reflexive through years of practice. After
		resting in this way, you gain the sam e benefit that a
		human does from 8 hours of sleep.
		<br>
		<b>Languages.</b> You can speak, read, and write Com m on
		and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and
		intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied,
		and their songs and poem s are fam ous am ong other
		races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
		Elvish ballads to their repertoires.
		<br>
		<b>Subrace.</b> Ancient divides am ong the elven people
		resulted in three main subraces: high elves, w ood elves,
		and dark elves, w ho are com m only called drow. Choose
		one of these subraces. In som e worlds, these subraces
		are divided still further (such as the sun elves and m oon
		elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can
		choose a narrower subrace.
	</p> <br>
	
	<h2>High Elf</h2>
	<p>
		As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of
		at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds
		of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type
		(which includes the gray elves and valley elves of
		Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the
		sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and
		reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to
		non-elves and even other elves. The other type
		(including the high elves of Greyhawk. the
		Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the m oon elves
		of the Forgotten Realms) are m ore com m on
		and m ore friendly, and often encountered
		am ong humans and other races.
		The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold
		elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and
		hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their
		eyes are golden, silver, or black. M oon elves (also
		called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler,
		with alabaster skin som etim es tinged with blue.
		They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue,
		but various shades of blond, brown, and red are
		not uncom m on. Their eyes are blue or green and
		flecked with gold.
		<br>

		ability for it.

		extra language of your choice

	<h2>Wood Elf</h2>
	<p>

		your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through
		your native forests. This category includes the wild
		elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of
		Dragonlance, as well as the races called w ood elves in
		Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, w ood
		elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves)
		are reclusive and distrusting o f non-elves.
		W ood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue,
		som etim es with traces of green. Their hair tends toward
		brow ns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or
		copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.
